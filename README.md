# Credits
- Utilized [compiler 1](https://github.com/ucsd-compilers-s23/cobra-reviews/blob/main/repos/compiler_01/src/compiler.rs) from the diamondback review as an inspiration to clean up my own cobra submission
- Utilized ChatGPT to generate inline lambdas to reduce code complexity, using the general prompt "Generate a lambda that can replace this code: **\<insert my own code here\>**"
